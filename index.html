        <h3>Summary</h3>
      <article>
        <h1>My online personality, could be summed up as the funny friend that doesnt have all the lights on up there.</h1>
        <h2>I mean, dont beleive me? <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EayCreVJogY" target="_blank">Click Here.</a></em></strong></h2>
        <h3>Im nowhere near famous, i like to do videos because I find it fun to make, infact I could write a whole page on my youtube history.</h3>
        <h4>At the end of the day, 117 subscribers isnt a bad place to start.</h4>
        <h5 style="font-size:1.5vw">On the topic of knowing me, I watch a lot of youtube, I guess youtube has replaced TV in my opinion I tend to watch videos more on the comedy side of things, I like to laugh, but who doesn't?
          Unironically I think Master Oogway speaks a lot of truths about life, who would have thought a talking turtle in a kids movie would be so wise.</h5>
